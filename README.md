<h2>Reporting Defect</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fill out the title
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Select the correct labels
<ul>
<li>Select A-MF, B-SF, or C-FIP to indicate severity. The meaning of these labels are explained in the issue tracker. Please conform to them; “A” should be reserved for things that break progression in the campaign or render the game impossible to play. Also select Always, Intermittent, Rare, or Single Observation to indicate how often you have run into it.</li>

<li>Your session log, output_log.txt, is stored here: C:\Users\YOURNAMEHERE\AppData\LocalLow\Pavonis Interactive\Terra Invicta. This is vital for us to track down any errors. It also becomes unwieldy if it hits about 30 MB in size, which can happen if you have a repeating error. In this case, copy the log to a separate file and then restart your session with a new file.</li>
<li>Screenshots may be taken with Control-Alt-PrtScn and pasted directly into the comment.</li>
<li>Your save games are in C:\Documents\My Games\TerraInvicta\Saves. Please zip your json file and paste it directly in the comment. Autosaves are made before every councilor assignment phase and battle, and can be very useful for us to reproduce a situation you have encountered.</li>
</ul>
